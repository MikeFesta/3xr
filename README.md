## About
3XR Inc was a venture-backed startup that I founded and ran from 2019-2021. The companyâ€™s purpose was to help brands create 3D models of their products for XR (augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D web, spatial computing, metaverse).

The company was too early for its time and unable to find a scalable business model before running out of funding.

This repository is a collection of most of the software that was written as part of the 3XR platform. It is being open sourced so that it may be of use to others working to digitize the world as the internet evolves from 2D to 3D.
