# Rabbit Consumer Endpoints for 3XR
################################################################################

# Directory Structure:
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# consume/      consumers in folders grouped by function
# models/       javascript helper classes
# node_modules/ NPM module install directory (see package-lock.json)
# run/          Bash scripts that start rabbit monitors in tmux


# Notes:
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# run/ contains shell scripts that launch tmux, split into windows for each job
# each tmux session has a name that can be attached to for monitoring
# tmux attach -t {session-name}
#
# run/ scripts are wrappers to call other code, typically located in /3xr/bash
#
# The consumers are written in javascript and run in node, directly on each
# processing machine (not inside a VM). This gives them access to hardware
# such as the GPU for use in blender.
#
# Each run/ script is grouped by access and hardware requirements so that they
# can be run selectivly per machine.
#
# The run/ scripts are started and kept alive through puppet, but can be
# monitored when ssh'd into the user account
#
# Rabbit messages are consumed in a round-robbin order
