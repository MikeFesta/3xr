Scripts for 3xr automated processing

These scripts do things like:
- Initialize the directory structure for a new model
- Rename Files
- Run photoshop
- Run blender
- Run meshroom

Model Processing Workflow:
- Import the photos and create the project directory
#> ./import_products.sh (also calls init_model.sh)
- Model folder is now created in /3xr/models/{product_name}
- [TODO] Auto-process with Meshroom and/or Blender
- [TODO] Post to BountyBoard and create .3xr file
    - Generate a random password and store in SQL
- {Artist does work on their dropbox VM}
- .3xr file uploaded to server (/3xr/network_drive/incoming_3xr)
#> ./extract_incoming_3xr.sh
- /3xr/models/{product} should now include additional models in /intermediate

Agisoft Specific Workflow (to be replaced with meshroom):
    #> ./create_model_from_scan.sh
    - Open the .blend file, set rotation and scale, save/close
    #> ./export_back_to_agisoft or ./export_low_poly_to_agisoft (if needed)
    #> ./reimport_scan.sh
    #> ./low_poly_from_scan.sh

#> ./bake_materials.sh
#> ./resize_textures.sh
#> ./usdz_export.sh (mac only)
#> ./gltf_export.sh
#> ./render_preview.sh
#> ./publish.sh
